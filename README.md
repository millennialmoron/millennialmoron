- 👋 Hi, I’m @millennialmoron (Kimberly).
- 👀 I’m interested in Full-Stack Web App & Software Development/Engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning patience...JK. I'm feeling pretty confident with JS (or as confident as one can be starting out), and I'm loving working with React/Next.js. So I'm currently more interested in honing those skills before I move into a new language and library. But I'm thinking next up on my list to conquer will be TypeScript and then Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. I'm loving the challenges so...LESSSS GOOOO!
- 📫 How to reach me: homing pigeons.
- I'll probably try and make this interesting later. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
